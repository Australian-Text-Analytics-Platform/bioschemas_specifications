## Profile

- [Profile (latest)](http://bioschemas.org/profiles/Taxon/)

This profile aims to denote a taxon by common properties such as its scientific name, authority, taxonomic rank and vernacular names. It is also a means to link to existing taxonomic registers where each taxon has a URI.

### Example Markup

This repository contains example markup for the Taxon profile generated by the [Biodiversity group](http://bioschemas.org/groups/Biodiversity/). Examples are purely illustrative and may use fictional data. 

Examples should be stored in a subfolder indicating which version of the profile it is valid for. Please check to ensure the example you are reading matches the version of the profile you are interested in.
